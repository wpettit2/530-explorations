# New Here? 
Just added the class? Remember to ask to join the `students` team. Also make sure to have the following software installed:  
- [R][download-r] Statistical Programming Language
- [RStudio][download-rstudio] Integrated Development Environment
- [git][download-git] for version control
- [TeX distribution][download-tex] for creating documents

# Explorations
These assignments are designed to enable engagement and practice with the concepts of applied statistics. 

### Git and github
Register for a github account and get comfortable with using git. [What is git/github][git-tour]? If you're having some trouble understanding or using git, read [this **presentation** from a UIUC stat student][coatless-presentation]. 

### RMarkdown
Your code should be readable and reproducible. We recommend using [RMarkdown][markdown-lessons] so that you can add comments, clarifications, and codechunks directly into the assignments. You should be able to knit assignments to pdf or html -- try it. If it does not work, troubleshoot.  

### To turn in your assignment: 
1. To start, [**fork** the repository][forking].
1. [**Clone**][ref-clone] the repository to your computer.
1. Modify the files and [**commit**][ref-commit] changes to complete your solution.
1. [**Push**][ref-push]/sync the changes up to GitHub.
1. [Create a **pull request**][pull-request] on the original repository to turn in the assignment.

### Feedback

After you submit your pull request, Professor Bowers will review your code and provide in-line feedback within the pull request.
